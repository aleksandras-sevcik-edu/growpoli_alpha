The program is based on Monte Carlo method that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results as polymer growth
upon irradiation can be described by a probabilistic interpretation. The code creates a simulation box of the desired size and 
chemical composition: the type of material of interest and its concentration, i.e. number of the material molecules per the 
volume of the box as well as their initial configuration. Several different types of material can be added. The molecules are
approximated as  geometrical cuboid bodies with the required length, width, and height that can connect with each other at the c
ertain angle and the configuration of the actual polymer can be achieved.
Once the initial state of the box is generated with the randomly placed molecular bodies,  the box is irradiated, and the set 
number of iterations will run applying the following algorithm:
    1.	The random unit cell selection in the simulation box equivalent to water radical initiation.
    2.	Identification and selection of molecules close to the event point
    3.	Radiation induced event probability calculation based on material capture coefficient, surrounding radiation field and the 
    configuration of initial molecular bodies at the event center:
        a.	Connection event
        b.	Break-down event
    4.	Translation and rotation of the molecular structure according to its momentum of inertia
